Ecologists scenario
*******************

I have a dataset of my own and I want to train a model on it. I want to be able to easily customize the training process and the model architecture.

- *Drop and play* : I have an observations file (.csv) and I want to train a model on different environmental variables (rasters, satellite imagery) without having to worry about the data loading.

- *Custom dataset* : I have my own dataset consisting of pre-extracted image patches and/or rasters and I want to train a model on it.

Inference scenario
******************

I have an observations file (.csv) and I want to predict the presence of species on a given area using a model I trained previously and a selected dataset or a shapefile I would provide.

Kaggle scenario
***************

I am a potential kaggle participant on the GeoLifeClef challenge. I want to train a model on the provided datasets without having to worry about the data loading, starting from a plug-and-play example.

- *GeoLifeClef2022* : contains a fully functionnal example of a model training on the GeoLifeClef2022 dataset, from data download, to training and prediction.
  
- *GeoLifeClef2023* : contains dataloaders for the GeoLifeClef2023 dataset (different from the GLC2022 dataloaders). The training and prediction scripts are not provided.
