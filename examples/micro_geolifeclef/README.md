# MicroGeoLifeCLEF example

This example serves as a Getting Started code.
It uses the MicroGeoLifeCLEF 2022 dataset which can be downloaded separately [here](https://lab.plantnet.org/seafile/f/b07039ce11f44072a548/?dl=1) (the code downloads it automatically if it was not downloaded before).
It consists of a subset of 10,000 observations from the GeoLifeCLEF 2022 dataset, retaining 1,000 observations in France of the 10 species most present in the original dataset belonging to two families (_Lamiaceae_ and _Orchidaceae_):
- _Himantoglossum hircinum_
- _Himantoglossum robertianum_
- _Melittis melissophyllum_
- _Mentha suaveolens_
- _Ophrys apifera_
- _Orchis purpurea_
- _Orchis mascula_
- _Perovskia atriplicifolia_
- _Stachys byzantina_
- _Vitex agnus-castus_


## Running the examples

To run the example `cnn_on_rgb_patches.py` on a single GPU using the `<DATASET_PATH>` as path to the dataset (will be downloaded automatically), use:
```script
python cnn_on_rgb_patches.py data.dataset_path=<DATASET_PATH> trainer.gpus=1
```

Similarly for the example `cnn_on_rgb_nir_patches.py`:
```script
python cnn_on_rgb_nir_patches.py data.dataset_path=<DATASET_PATH> trainer.gpus=1
```


## Additional notes

For debugging purposes, using the `trainer.fast_dev_run=true` and `hydra.job.name=test` parameters can be handy:
```script
python cnn_on_rgb_patches.py data.dataset_path=<DATASET_PATH> trainer.gpus=1 +trainer.fast_dev_run=true +hydra.job.name=test
```

Be careful when using any path argument like `data.dataset_path`, since each `.yaml` file contains a `hydra.run.dir` argument set with a default value of `outputs/<hydra job name>/<date>` (with `<hydra job name>` itself defaulting to the name of the file executed), the current working directory will be changed to said path once the config file is read and loaded. Therefore any other path argument should be written relatively to that `hydra.run.dir` path.
