# Sentinel-2A raster example (training)

This `torchgeo` based example performs multi-class species training/prediction using a CNN model on Sentinel-2A raster data and geolocated plant observations.

Sentinel-2A satellite data is hosted and available on [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a) (MPC).\
By default, sample data is downloaded from MPC, consisting of 1 tile, 4 bands (RGB-IR).

## Data

### Sample data

The sample data used in this example consists of:
- **Satellite images**: the RGB-IR bands of the tile `T31TEJ` from the Sentinel-2A satellite (which contains the city of Montpellier, France). Each band is a GeoTIFF file with a resolution of 10m.

- **Observations**: a CSV file containing a list of geolocated plant observations from the [Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/) database. The CSV file contains the following columns:
  - `observation_id`: unique identifier of the observation
  - `species_id`: unique identifier of the plant species
  - `GBIF_species_name`: GBIF species name
  - `latitude`: latitude of the observation
  - `longitude`: longitude of the observation
  - `subset`: subset of the observation (`train`, `val` or `test`)

  (The CSV is a dummie file based on the Pl@ntNet observation database so species IDs and geographic coordinates do not reflect real observations.)

Species include:

### Data loading and adding more data

- **Satellite images**

The Sentinel-2A tiles are looked for in the `<path_to_example>/dataset` directory and they are loaded based on their standard naming convention, following several rules are set in `malpolon.data.datasets.torchgeo_sentinel2.RasterSentinel2`.

```python 
  filename_glob = "T*_B0*_10m.tif"
  filename_regex = r"T31TEJ_20190801T104031_(?P<band>B0[\d])"
  date_format = "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S"
  is_image = True
  separate_files = True
  all_bands = ["B02", "B03", "B04", "B08"]
  plot_bands = ["B04", "B03", "B02"]
```

- `filename_glob` is the glob pattern used to find the files in the directory.
- `filename_regex` is the regular expression used to extract the band name from the file name. The argument `?P<band>` is used by `torchgeo` to identify the band name based on `all_bands`.
- `date_format` is the date format used to extract the date from the file name.
- `is_image` is a boolean indicating whether the file is an image or not.
- `separate_files` is a boolean indicating whether the bands are stored in separate files or not.
- `all_bands` is the list of all bands available in your dataset.
- `plot_bands` is the list of bands to plot when calling `plot()` on the dataset.

To extend your dataset, simply drop more files in the `<path_to_example>/dataset` directory with the same naming convention, and adapt your rules to select the new bands and/or tiles.

- **Observations**

The observations are loaded from the `<path_to_example>/dataset/observations.csv` file. The name of the file can vary so long as it matches the name specified in the configuration file.

To extend your dataset, simply add more observations to the CSV file.

## Usage

Examples are **ready-to-use scripts** that can be executed by a simple Python command. Every data, model and training parameters are specified in a `.yaml` configuration file located in the `config/` directory.

### Training

To train an example's model such as `resnet18` in `cnn_on_rgbnir_torchgeo.py`, run the following command:

```script
python cnn_on_rgbnir_torchgeo.py
```

You can also specify any of your config parameters within your command through arguments such as:

```script
python cnn_on_rgbnir_torchgeo.py data.dataset_path=<DATASET_PATH> trainer.gpus=1
```

Config parameters provided in this example are listed in the [Parameters](#parameters) section.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Prediction

This example is configured to run in training mode by default but if you want to re-use it for prediction, follow these steps:

- Change config file parameter `run.predict` to `true` 
- Specify a path to your model checkpoint in parameter `run.checkpoint_path`

Note that any of these parameters can also be passed through command line like shown in the previous section and overrule those of the config file.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Parameters

All hyperparameters are specified in a `.yaml` configuration file located in a `config/` directory, which is read and transformed into a dictionary by the [**Hydra**](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) library.

You can parametrize your models and your training routine through your `.yaml` config file which is split in main sections :

- **trainer** : parameters to tweak your training session via PyTorchLightning Trainer class\
  This section is passed on to your PyTorchLightning trainer.
- **run** : parameters related to prediction and transfer learning\
  This section is passed on to your PyTorchLightning checkpoint loading method.
- **model** : defines which model you want to load, from which source, and contains models hyperparameters. You can pass any model hyperparameter listed in your provider's model builder.\
  This section is passed on to your prediction system _(e.g. `ClassificationSystem`)_.
- **optimizer** : your optimizer and metrics hyperparameters.\
  This section is passed on to your prediction system _(e.g. `ClassificationSystem`)_.
- **task** : defines the type of deep learning task chosen for your experiment (currently only supporting any of `['classification_binary', 'classification_multiclass', 'classification_multilabel']`)\
  This section is passed on to your prediction system _(e.g. `ClassificationSystem`)_.
- **data** : data related information such as the path to your dataset or batch size.\
  This section is passed on to your data module _(e.g. `Sentinel2TorchGeoDataModule`)_.

### Transfer learning

- **Resuming training (same model)**

To resume a training or perform transfer learning with the same model without changing its channels, update your configuration file checkpoint path, and run your script in training mode:

```yaml
run:
  predict: false
  checkpoint_path: <PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT>
```

A new output folder will be generated.

- **Transfer with model modifications**

Be aware that for now there are no tools provided to easily freeze or manage intermediate layers during training. Thus you may encounter challenges when trying to train a model with pre-trained weights _(e.g. from ImageNet)_ on 4-channels (or more) data like RGB-IR as most of the pre-trained models are done over 3-channels RGB images.

However, Malpolon provides methods to modify your **first** and **last** model layers. These methods are located in `malpolon.models.model_builder.py`:

- `change_first_convolutional_layer_modifier()`
- `change_last_layer_modifier()`
- `change_last_layer_to_identity_modifier()`

Furthermore to perform transfer learning with model modifications you can :
- Train from scratch by setting config hyperparameter `model.model_kwargs.pretrained` to false
- Manually change your model and use a freeze strategy before `trainer.fit` (in your main script) to only train 3 bands at once
- Restrain your trainings to 3 bands and merge several output features

Future updates will aim at making this step easier.

## Additional notes
### Debugging

For debugging purposes, using the `trainer.fast_dev_run=true` and `hydra.job.name=test` parameters can be handy:

```bash
python cnn_on_rgb_patches.py data.dataset_path=<DATASET_PATH> trainer.gpus=1 +trainer.fast_dev_run=true +hydra.job.name=test
```
