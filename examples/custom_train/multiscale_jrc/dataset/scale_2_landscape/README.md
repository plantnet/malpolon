LUCAS photos (orthogonal & cover) go here.

The metadata file to be used should be a slice of the LUCAS exif file, over the `id` column.

The file paths are directly taken from columns `file_path_gisco_<view>` as the file structure is kept form the year of the survey and down.
GPS coordinates are registered in columns `['gps_long', 'gps_lat']`.
